manga-js
========

An open source desktop manga reader in Javascript using React and Redux. All you need to do is paste in the manga URL
from a supported site (right now only mangareader.net) and manga-js will automatically parse the manga data from the site
and you can just read the manga from manga-js. This allows you to avoid all of the annoying pop-ups, unwanted redirects, or potentially malicious ads
from reading the manga on the manga site and also allow you to save your current progress or download the manga for offline reading.

## Running

In order to build and run manga-js, you have to first have npm installed. Then run `npm install` in the project directory
and then `npm start` to start the electron application.

## Testing

To run the jest tests, run `npm test`.
